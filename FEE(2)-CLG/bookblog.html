            <h3>The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Randy Pausch</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
            <p>If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?

                When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didnt have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams, wasnt about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.</p>

            <h3>The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller</h3>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Madeline Miller</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★★</p>
            <p>Published in September 2011, The Songs of Achilles is Madeline Miller’s first book.

                It is a retelling of the story of Achilles from Patroclus’ point of view who is an exiled ex-prince. At the heart of the story lies a marvelous love story amidst the War of Troy between the two protagonists.
                
                With an LGBTQIA+ theme, The Song of Achilles is not just a beautiful story of how the purest of love blossoms and matures over a lifetime, but is a book breaking stereotypes since September 2011.
                
                The blurb of the book reads –
                
                Achilles, “the best of all the Greeks,” son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful, irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods’ wrath.</p>
